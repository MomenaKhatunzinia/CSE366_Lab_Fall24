# Lab Task 1: Pygame-Based Agent-Environment Simulation
To develop a modular Pygame simulation where an agent can move within a defined environment using keyboard controls. This task will reinforce your understanding of object- oriented programming, modular code structure, and using Pygame for interactive simulations.
# Lab Task 2 : Simulation of UCS and A* Algorithms for Pathfinding
two pathfinding algorithms, Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A Search*, to navigate an agent through a grid environment. 
Algorithm Implementation
o Implement Uniform Cost Search (UCS) in the agentâ€™s movement logic to calculate
the shortest path by cumulative cost.
o Check the Figure 1 for Uniform Cost Search results and Figure 2 for A* Search
results.
o Implement A* Search using an appropriate heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance) to
estimate the cost from the current position to each task.
o Compare the path costs of UCS and A* by calculating and displaying the cumulative
path cost for each algorithm as the agent completes tasks.

# Lab Task 3 : Lab Task 2 : Simulation of UCS and A* Algorithms for Pathfinding
Objective
Implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize class scheduling while minimizing con-
flicts, balancing student preferences, and respecting time slot constraints. The solution
should include real-time visualization of schedules and fitness evaluation.
Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating an optimal class schedule for students. Each class has
a specific duration and priority. Each student has unique availability and time slot
preferences. The goal is to:
1. Minimize scheduling conflicts.
2. Maximize alignment with student preferences.
3. Balance the schedule efficiently across time slots.
